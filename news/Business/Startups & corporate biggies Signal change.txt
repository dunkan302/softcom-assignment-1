BENGALURU/MUMBAI: As the furore over changes in WhatsAppâs privacy policy grows, a wide range of companies have started mandating migration to messaging platform Signal. These include new-age tech startups, older corporates and their senior leadership teams who are now using Signal for day-to-day work chats and sharing of internal documents. Paytm and PhonePe, both of which are threatened by WhatsAppâs recent entry into payments, used the controversy to encourage their teams to shift out of WhatsApp. Naveen Jindal-led Jindal Steel & Power is moving out too. Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group, has just installed Signal. Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran has been using Signal for some time with several of the groupâs senior leadership also using the same platform. Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma told TOI he has asked everyone in his team to move from WhatsApp for work communications. âIt is clear that we will move off formally from WhatsApp,â Sharma told TOI. PhonePe co-founder Sameer Nigam has moved around half of his team to Signal, along with his office groups, according to a series of tweets from him on Monday. In response to a tweet from serial entrepreneur and Cred founder Kunal Shah that network effects are like religion and most people like to stay in what they were born in, Nigam tweeted, âThis time is diff (different). Product wise, Signal has arrived! Moved 1000+ @PhonePe-rs to Signal. Recreated all my work groups. Moved my family groups. Seamlessly. Zero switching cost,â he said. @kunalb11 This time is diff. Product wise, Signal has arrived! Moved 1000+ @PhonePe-rs to Signal. Recreated all mâ¦ https://t.co/dqEjCGhAUy— Sameer.Nigam (@_sameernigam) 1610345798000Jindal Steel & Powerâs chief HR officer Pankaj Lochan said, âThe company is looking at the need of moving away from WhatsApp and considering shifting its day-to-day critical official communication from WhatsApp to the relatively safer messaging platforms like Signal, Telegram, or Google Chat/Meet. Since Gmail is the companyâs official platform, there is a thought to make Google Chat/Meet the official channel for communication. The challenge at manufacturing units would be to integrate everyone at the level of frontline workers and those who may not have email accounts.â WhatsAppâs privacy changes, which include sharing of certain data sets with Facebook, will be effective from next month. The controversy comes at a time when WhatsAppâs daily downloads have touched its lowest since September 2020, according to data from app tracker Sensor Tower. Even in Silicon Valley, prominent voices have called for a shift out of WhatsApp. Investor and former senior Facebook employee Chamath Palihapitiya tweeted that WhatsApp had just killed its best feature â privacy. âPlease no longer text me on WhatsApp. Download @signalapp,â his tweet said. Starting in Feb, WhatsApp will begin sharing all kinds of data with Facebook. They just killed their best feature -â¦ https://t.co/RGOn0pYrfV— Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) 1610293989000Earlier, Teslaâs founder Elon Musk tweeted urging people to use Signal.
