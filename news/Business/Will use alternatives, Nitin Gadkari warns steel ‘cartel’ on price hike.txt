NEW DELHI: Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday threw a googly at the steel industry, saying his ministry will allow use of âsynthetic fibreâ and âcomposite fibreâ bars in place of steel products for building roads and bridges to reduce cost in the face of âartificialâ hike in price of the key construction raw material. Addressing the Foundation Day of an industry house in Mumbai, Gadkari said the steel industry has increased the prices which is ânot justifiedâ considering that there has been no escalation in labour, raw material and power costs. âEvery steel producer has got its own iron ore mines. So, jacking up prices is a type of black marketing and the cement industry is also habitual of this. I am going to settle my issue with them. Now we are planning to allow synthetic fibre in place of steel. There has been a lot of inventions and now we will allow this for bridge and road construction,â the minister said. Big steel, cement firms operating as a cartel; need to place regulator: Nitin GadkariGadkari said he has been constantly pursuing the matter and he will see that the steel manufacturers reduce the prices. âNearly 40% of the steel and cement are used in highway construction. If they donât reduce prices, we will formulate alternative policies,â he warned. Synthetic fibre and composite fibre bars are being used in different parts of the world and this can reduce the requirement of steel in construction projects. Being corrosion-proof and light, these are emerging as alternatives to steel, though these cannot replace steel completely. Top civil engineers in the government and private sectors said there have been several innovations and use of synthetic fibre, composite fibre bars and fibre-reinforced concrete is catching up. âBut there are some issues that need to be addressed. Most of the structures we are building should have at least 100 years of life. So far, there is hardly any trial of the composite fibre or synthetic fibre for 20-30 years. There is a need to try the products and see their performance,â said an engineer who didnât wish to be identified. The government is now allowing private players to use new technologies and materials in their projects, which have been tried and tested. In such a case, the companies will take responsibility any defect under the âdefect liability clauseâ. A senior engineer from a private company said, âIn all government-funded projects, the defect liability is only for 10 years in case of a standalone structure and for all others itâs five years. So, we need to try before giving the go-ahead to such materials,â he added.
