CHENNAI: UltraTech Cement Limited, a subsidiary of Aditya Birla Group, has announced a more than double net profit of Rs 1,584 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, as compared to Rs 712 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. This is largely driven by rural and semi-urban housing demand, pick-up in government led infrastructure aided incremental cement demand. And pent-up urban demand is expected to improve with the gradual return of the migrant workforce. Its consolidated net sales stood at Rs 12,144 crore, as against Rs 10,261 crore over the corresponding period of the previous year. During the quarter, UltraTechâs Board approved capex of Rs 5,477 crore towards increasing the companyâs capacity by 12.8 mtpa with a mix of brown field and green field expansion. The additional capacity is being created in the fast-growing markets of the east, central and north regions of the country, the company said in a statement.  âThis expansion is in addition to the companyâs 6.7 mtpa capacity addition that is currently underway in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal, which has picked up pace and is expected to get commissioned by FY22, in a phased manner,â it said. Upon completion of the latest round of expansion, the companyâs capacity will grow to 136.25 mtpa, reinforcing its position as the third largest cement company in the world, outside of China. Recovery from the Covid-19 led disruption of the economy has been rapid. This has been fuelled by quicker demand stabilisation, supply side restoration and greater cost efficiencies. On its recent acquisition, the statement said, âThe 14.6 mtpa cement plants acquired during the previous financial year have been making good progress on integration with production ramped up to nearly 84% toward the exit of Q3. The timely acquisition has enabled the company to meet the growing demand in the central and east markets.â
