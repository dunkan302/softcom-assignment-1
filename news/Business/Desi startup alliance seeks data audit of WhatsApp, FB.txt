BENGALURU: The newly formed Indian alliance, Atamnirbhar Digital India Foundation (ADIF), has written to the government, saying it should conduct a data audit of WhatsApp and its parent firm, the social media giant, on user data flowing outside India. ADIF was formed to fight BigTech firms like Facebook and Google. It is an internet body thatâs been set up by local entrepreneurs and investors to create a level playing field for Indian startups. It also aims to work with the government on regulatory and legal aspects of policy making in light of increased competition from major US firms. âGovernment may conduct an audit through CERT-In (government agency) to check any sharing of data of individual or business users with Facebook and its subsidiaries. Since WhatsApp proposes to share business interaction details of Indian customers with its group companies like Facebook, WhatsApp should be prohibited from offering any services which deal with personal sensitive data of Indian users,â the note sent to IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, and reviewed by TOI, said. ADIF secretary general Ajay Data confirmed the same to TOI. Despite multiple clarifications from WhatsApp on its privacy policy changes, it continues to draw scrutiny from many quarters. ADIF has also highlighted that the government should ensure WhatsApp continues treating Indian users and businesses on a par with global markets even as the government has asked it to withdraw the proposed policy changes. âWhatsApp has rolled out separate privacy and data sharing policies for Europe and India wherein the protections offered to EU citizens are far greater than those offered to Indian users. In fact, WhatsApp does not share data of its European Union users with Facebook for the purpose of improving its products or advertisements. This raises questions as to WhatsAppâs intentions,â the note said.
