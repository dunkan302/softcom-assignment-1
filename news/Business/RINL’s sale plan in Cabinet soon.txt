NEW DELHI: The department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) is readying a proposal for strategic sale of steel maker Rashtriya Ispat Nigam (RINL) and it is likely to be sent to the Union Cabinet shortly for approval. RINL is a navratna steel PSU and the corporate entity of Vishakhapatnam Steel Plant under the steel ministry. The government had been making efforts to go for a strategic sale of the steel plant for 2-3 years but the efforts did not make much headway. Sources said the idea is to go for 100% sale in the next fiscal. RINL has been notching up losses and the global slowdown had hurt its exports. âWith steel prices improving and demand expected to pick up, there is a view that this is a right time to go for a strategic sale,â said an official, who did not wish to be identified, adding that expectations are that there is a strong interest for the plant. The move to go for a strategic sale of RINL adds to the strong pipeline of such offers that the government has lined up for the next fiscal. The governmentâs ambitious move to wrap up some big-ticket strategic sales such as petroleum major BPCL and national carrier Air India has not materialised so far. Officials said these high profile sales are likely to be completed next year as the groundwork has been done to ensure that they go through. Since assuming power in 2014, the NDA government had vowed to press ahead with strategic sales, which involves giving up management control, but the process has been hobbled by a string of factors. The government has set a target of raising Rs 2.1 lakh crore from asset sales in state-run companies in the current fiscal but officials reckon that it will be missed by a wide margin.
