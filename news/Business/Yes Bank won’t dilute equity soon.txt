Mumbai: Yes Bank will not be raising capital via equity soon and the recent board approval is only part of an enabling provision to reduce its time-to-market in future, the bankâs MD & CEO Prashant Kumar, said. He added that the bankâs deposits will cover its loan book by end-March despite growth in advances. âWe expect the credit-deposit ratio to be 100% by the end of March from 116% at the end of December,â Kumar said. He said that the bankâs strategy is to use its digital capability to grow retail deposits and loans. According to its December quarter results, the bankâs capital adequacy ratio is 19.6%, while common equity tier I capital is 13.1%, âWe are well-capitalised but we decided to go through the process, which will also require a shareholder approval, so that we are in readiness,â said Kumar. The private bank, which was revived by an RBI-initiated resolution process, had seen a third of its deposits being withdrawn by wary customers before the central bank placed a moratorium on withdrawals. Since then, deposits have bounced back growing 36% in the first nine months of the fiscal. The bank on Friday reported a profit of Rs 151 crore in the third quarter as against a loss of Rs 18,560 crore in the year-ago period. The bank also said that it has received more information on accounts linked to whistleblower allegations. âAll the loans are fully provided for and there will not be any financial implication even if any more loans are declared as fraud,â said Kumar. He said that Cox & Kings, which has been in the news for action by authorities, has already been declared a fraud. The bank had earlier sought approval from the RBI for a âbad bankâ that will take over troubled loans and is awaiting a response from the regulator. While the bank has a Rs 1,000-crore exposure to DHFL, it does not expect any major recovery this year. âI do not expect the resolution will be implemented before March 31. Besides, we are unsecured lenders and donât know how much we will get,â he said. âOur focus is on retail and MSME. We have disbursed almost Rs 12,000 crore in the third quarter and this path would continue,â said Kumar. He said the bank was rationalising expenditure with operating expenses reduced by 13% and more branch mergers in the offing. The bank has already converted some of its rural branches into business correspondent centres. To augment fee-income, the bank has tied up with HDFC Life and SBI Life for distribution on the life insurance side and ICICI Lombard and SBI General on the non-life insurance side.
