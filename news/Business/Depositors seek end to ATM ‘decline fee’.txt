Mumbai: The All India Bank Depositorsâ Association of India in their pre-policy meeting with RBI governor Shaktikanta Das have asked for the withdrawal of an âunjustâ âtransaction decline chargeâ on debit cards. Each time a person without adequate balance in his/her account tries to withdraw cash from an ATM or uses debit cards to make a payment, the bank penalises him/her Rs 25 plus GST as âtransaction declineâ charge. This can be termed as the digital version of a charge for bouncing a cheque. âSuch exorbitant penalty for digitally paying consumers âdisincentivisesâ them, thereby many are moving away from digital payments. This applies more to the marginalised class of depositors who may not always have adequate funds in their accounts,â the association said in its written representation. The body said that these charges are not only unjust but also against the principle of âtransaction declineâ as this is not like issuing a cheque to a third-party but like a depositor walking into a branch and trying to draw cash. Also, there is no cost to the card-issuing bank in such transactions. âThe NPCI does not consider it as a transaction and hence no interchange is paid by the card-issuing bank,â the letter said. âThough, we can still understand that as a deterrent, banks charge for cheque bounce, where cheque/ECS returns involve third parties and create distrust in the payment mode. However, declined POS/ATM transactions due to insufficient balances is nowhere on a par with cheque/ECS returns. It does not involve any intent of systemic inconvenience or distrust to a third party,â the bank said. In its representation to the RBI, the association said that prior to January 2020, SBI was charging Rs 17.7 per non-cash digital transaction for over 12 crore basic savings bank deposit accounts. âSBI has agreed to refund the exorbitant charges only for the period starting January 2020, but not prior to that. As disclosed by SBI, during FY20, SBI collected over Rs 150 crore towards service charges from such accounts,â the association said. Another wrongful charge highlighted by the association was the one imposed by payment aggregators on consumers for making digital payments on e-commerce websites. While the merchants and the banks claimed that they were not the ones pocketing the charge, they did facilitate these charges. which were against the government mandate. The association also urged the RBI governor not to cut interest rates as inflation has been high and oil prices were firming up.
