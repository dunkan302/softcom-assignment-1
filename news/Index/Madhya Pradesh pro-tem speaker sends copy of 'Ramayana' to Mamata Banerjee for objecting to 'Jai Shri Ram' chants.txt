BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh pro-tem speaker and senior BJP MLA, Rameshwar Sharma has sent a copy of holy 'Ramayana' to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee after she objected to the chants of `Jai Shri Ram' and refused to deliver speech in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a function in Kolkata, on Saturday. Sharma said calling chants of `Jai Shri Ram' an insult, only to woo the Bangladeshi Muslim vote bank is surprising and painful. Greeted with âJai Shri Ramâ chants, Didi refuses to speak"It's painful to learn that chants of `Jai Shri Ram' insulted Mamata Banerjee during the birth anniversary function of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Lord Ram is not only Maryada Purushottam (most dignified) but also a constitutional identity. Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar, one of the architects of the Indian Constitution, had mentioned Lord Ram in the Constitution. Even Mahatma Gandhi had dreamt about Ram Rajya (Rule of Lord Ram founded on righteousness and integrity)," Sharma told TOI. #WATCH: #MadhyaPradesh protem speaker #RameshwarSharma says that he is sending a copy of Ramayana to West Bengal CMâ¦ https://t.co/5ze8yYp1VU— TOI Bhopal (@TOIBhopalNews) 1611485406000The West Bengal chief minister had expressed strong humiliation after a group of BJP supporters chanted `Jai Shri Ram' when she got up to speak at the official event commemorating Netaji Subhas Chandra Boseâs 125th birth anniversary in Kolkata, on Saturday. "This is not a political event. I am grateful to the PM for organising this in Kolkata. But it does not suit you to invite someone and then insult that person. I refuse to speak as a mark of protest. Jai Hind! Jai Bangla!â Mamata had said in the presence of PM Narendra Modi. Mamata's remarks evoked mixed reactions all over the country with BJP alleging vote bank politics behind her protest. MP pro tem Speaker Sharma further said, "A few people who had questioned the existence of Lord Ram are nowhere. Some of them are now contributing to the fundraising drive for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. The land of Kolkata is known for Ramkrishna Mission and the birth place of Swami Vivekanand. Raising objections over chanting Jai Shri Ram to woo Bangladeshi Muslim votes is painful indeed." Sharma, in a letter attached to the copy of Ramayan said, "I am sending a copy of holy Ramayana with this letter and requesting you to spare time to go through the holy book so that you could well understand the character of Lord Ram. I hope you will gain wisdom. I pray you learn to chant "Jai Shri Ram'. Stop opposing Lord Rama. You have insulted Lord Ram during an event in Bengal. The people of Bengal will teach you a lesson in the upcoming assembly elections."
