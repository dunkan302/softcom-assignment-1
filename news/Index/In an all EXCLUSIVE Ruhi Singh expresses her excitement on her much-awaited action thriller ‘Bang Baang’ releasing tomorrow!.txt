Recently we have seen many divas like Lara Dutta and Sushmita Sen create waves in the action space on the digital platform, and joining them is yet another beauty queen, Ruhi Singh! By featuring in Ekta Kapoor's action-thriller franchise 'Bang Baang â The Sound of Crimes' opposite Faisal Shaikh, Ruhi is all set to showcase yet another versatile role in the web series under the banner of ALT Balaji. The former beauty queen who has been nominated for the Times most desirable list 2021, in a candid chat, opens up about her character â Meera, love for action-hero roles, her upcoming projects, and more. We know you are trained in martial arts, and so how was the experience shooting for an action thriller?I have been training in martial arts, karate, Shaolin Kung Fu, and a beginner in onscreen combat, and so it was an excellent experience to showcase all of these skills onscreen. I thoroughly enjoyed playing Meera in the series. Growing up, my favorite action hero was Xena: Warrior Princess, and Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie has always inspired me as an actor, so I always wanted to do an action role like her. I love action, and I've done my own stunts in 'Bang Baang.' We have seen a severe side of you in the trailer, but yet you managed to bring in elegance with your performance; how do you always manage to do that?Yes, I play the role of a serious cop. It's different from all the roles I have ever played, and Meera is pretty elegant. I think it's extremely important to understand a character altogether to portray it perfectly. Rather than exaggerating a performance, I think it's important to feel the emotion, so I think there is a certain elegance and subtlety to Meera. As an actor, it's my dream to play diverse characters and bring their stories to life. I hope these characters and their tales enrich you as much as playing them enriches me. You have earlier performed with Faisal in a music video, and your on-screen chemistry was a superhit, so can we expect the same from Raghu and Meera?Yes, 'Maangi Duaein' with Faisal was quite a big hit, and in fact, we just finished another one together. Our onscreen chemistry is definitely loved by many out there, but I also feel that it's essential to be comfortable with your co-actor and, as an actor, a part of your job to try to give your all, to make sure your chemistry works. I always make sure that I make my co-stars comfortable, which then reflect in our performance. We have seen you keep busy even amid the pandemic; share your experience shooting amid restriction? Yes, I am the person who can't sit idle, and I always have to do something or the other, which is why during the pandemic I initiated a talk show called 'Yuhi with Ruhi', which was really popular as I spoke to my friends from the (Bollywood) industry. I also worked on my fitness and improved my skills -- I tried to learn different dialects and learned a few dance forms from Youtube. I am also studying law, and I make sure my syllabus is completed on time, so I'm generally a very busy person. It's obviously an extraordinary time; everything is new, but then it's imperative to be careful, so I followed all Covid protocols and tried to keep myself secure during shoots. Soon after the trailer was received, your fans showered their love and appreciation; how do you feel with less than 24 hours to its release? What message would you like to share with your fans?I am who I am because of the audience. I was a total outsider to the industry and had been standing firm on my terms from being Miss India to an actress to an internet sensation and being loved by millions on social media. All of this was possible because of my fans and my hard work, and I am super grateful to them for being my rock! I am so thrilled for 'Bang Baang' to release because, firstly, Meera is a character that is very close to my heart, and we have worked really hard on this project. And yes, my fans have been showering us with love and appreciation, and everybody is so excited. It was quite evident after our trailer and teaser started trending in a real short span from its release, so I can't even imagine what will happen when the show delivers tomorrow. The series is anticipated to be an absolute hit; we are thrilled to see Ruhi back in action; what about you?
