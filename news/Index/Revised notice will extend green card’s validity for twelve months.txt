MUMBAI: The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has from January replaced the sticker that is currently issued to lawful permanent residents (aka green card holders) to extend the validity of their green card, with a revised Form 1-797 â notice of action. Green card holders are required to file Form I-90, for replacement when their green cards expire or are about to expire. The revised Form I-797 notice will serve as a receipt for this application. This notice is expected to be received, by mail, approximately ten days after USCIS has accepted the application. When presented together with the green card, the revised Form I-797 notice will extend the green cardâs validity for 12 months from the date on the front of the green card and will serve as temporary proof of the holderâs lawful permanent resident status. âThis change ensures that those with a recently expired green card will have documentation of identity, employment authorisation, and authorisation to return to the US following temporary foreign travel,â states USCIS. Form I-90 applicants who have not been issued a notice for a biometrics appointment and are in possession of their green card, will no longer have to visit an application support center to obtain temporary evidence of their lawful permanent resident status. However, those applicants who have already been scheduled for a biometrics appointment will not receive a revised notice and will be issued an extension sticker at their biometrics appointment. USCIS is using the previously submitted biometrics and in the wake of the pandemic, this revised process will save a trip to the center and also mitigate backlogs.
