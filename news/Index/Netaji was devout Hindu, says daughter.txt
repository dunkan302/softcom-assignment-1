KOLKATA: Netaji Subhas Chandra Boseâs Germany-based daughter Anita B Pfaff chose his 125th birth anniversary on Saturday to paint the person behind the legend as "a devout Hindu", albeit one who was "tolerant towards all other religions". "He inspired his followers â members of the Indian National Army, his friends and his family â to respect other religions and yet be very religious himself," Pfaff said in a video message posted on the official Twitter handle of the Indian consulate general in Munich.

He envisaged an India that would be "modern, enlightened and, at the same time, deeply rooted in history, philosophy and religious traditions", she said.

In Kolkata, Netaji Research Bureau chairman and former Trinamool MP Sugata Bose, who is one of Subhas Chandra Boseâs grandnephews, said it was more important to follow Netaji and Gandhijiâs ideals of uniting all castes and communities than giving his birth anniversary a particular tag.

I much prefer Deshanayak Diwas," Sugata Bose said after seeing off PM Narendra Modi after his visit to Netajiâs Elgin Road residence.
