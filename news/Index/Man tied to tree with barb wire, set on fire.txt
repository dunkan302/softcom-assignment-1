BAREILLY: A 45-year-old man was tied to a tree with barbed wires and set on fire in Sheeshgarh area of Bareilly allegedly by his neighbours over an old enmity. Dharampalâs daughter told police that he was scared for the last few days and often used to say that he might be killed. His charred body was found on Saturday evening. Station house officer (SHO) of Sheeshgarh, Rajkumar Bhardwaj, told TOI, âOur forensic team has collected samples and we have also started investigation. The circumstantial evidence suggests that the man was forcefully tied to the tree and set on fire.â An FIR against two persons was filed on late Sunday evening. Post-mortem examination was conducted on Sunday which confirmed the cause of death as shock due to ante-mortem burn injuries, which suggested that Dharampal was alive when he was set on fire. The condition of the body suggested that he would have died a painful death, sources said. Dharampal had gone to sleep on Friday night after dinner and went missing a few hours later. His charred body was recovered about 800 metres from the house. He was not wearing slippers. His brother, Bishanlal, suspected that Dharampal was abducted and murdered. His brother-in-law, Mangal Dev, said, âThe body was tightly tied to the tree. He was brutally killed .â Dharampal, who completed MSc in agriculture in 2000, was jobless. Police said that he was upset since 2003, after the partition of property. SSP Bareilly Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, âDharampalâs death is still a mystery and the family members are yet to lodge a complaint. We have asked the family to give us a written complaint. The note left by Dharampal is also unclear. Two suspects, who are neighbours and named in the note, are under detention and they are being questioned as well.â
