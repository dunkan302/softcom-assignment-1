Hospitals and health centres across several cities and towns in many states and UTs could not achieve their Covid-19 vaccination targets on Tuesday thanks to continuing hesitancy among health workers in taking the shot, with a section of doctors in hospitals in Hyderabad even writing letters to their superiors, saying they would rather wait for more options before they take a jab. Reports of several cases of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) were among the factors which caused health workers to skip the inoculations despite their names listed at the centres. âThereâre cases of adverse effects being reported for the available vaccines and one is still under trial,â read a letter by a senior resident at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) in Hyderabad, referring to Covaxin. âI prefer to wait until there is a better vaccine available,â the doctor said in the letter. As many as 67 health workers at TIMS refused to take the jab on Tuesday. âIf I take the vaccine now, I will not be able to take another vaccine in the near future, which might have better efficacy,â wrote a senior doctor from Osmania General Hospital, where less than 200 out of the 600 beneficiaries listed took the vaccine Scores of health workers skipped inoculation in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in Maharashtra because of hesitancy. The deputy director for health services, Sanjay Deshmukh, said the refusals were due to anxiety over safety and efficacy of the vaccines. In Nagpurâs Government Medical College and Hospital, the exclusive centre for Covaxin in the city, only 29 out of 100 beneficiaries took the jab on Tuesday.
