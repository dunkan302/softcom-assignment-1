MANALI: Tribal women of Khurik village of Himachalâs Spiti valley have banned sale, purchase and use of liquor in the village. The villagers, in an effort to prevent government schools from closing down, have also decided to put at least one child in government school. Khurik village at an altitude of 12,000ft has nearly 50 families. The mahila mandal (women group) passed the resolution that nobody in village will produce, sell or buy the liquor. The resolution has provision of fine of Rs 1,000 if anybody caught with liquor. All the residents agreed to the decision. The panchayat also supported mahila mandal. The villagers have put up awareness slogans in the village to encourage residents not to drink. It was also decided by the villagers that they will not allow anybody to open liquor shop in the village. Kamla Devi, Khurik mahila mandal president said, âThe decision to ban liquor production and sale in village was taken unanimously when Dorje Dolma was our president. Liquor is the enemy of our future generations and control on it is need of hour. We are happy that all residents honoured the decision. Other villages also want to follow us. Although we live in remote areas, we strive for better living, good society and better environment.â Homemade liquor is widely used in cold deserts of Lahaul-Spiti, especially during winter months. The residents prefer homemade liquor over other commercial brands of alcohol. Youths consuming liquor has become a matter of concern in many areas. According to sources, the women of Khurik took this decision to prevent their youth from becoming addicted to liquor. Besides ban on liquor, the villagers also decided that at least one child from each family should study in government school, which otherwise is on the verge of closure due to decreasing strength. Lobzang Tandup, a resident of Khurik village, said, âMahila mandal women are doing great job. Ban of liquor is being taken seriously in the village. A warning signage was also put up in the village. This is also true that we have decided to admit at least one child from each family to government schools,â he said. Mahila mandals of Lahaul-Spiti district are known for decisions favouring socio-environment. Sometime ago, women here had imposed a strict ban on the hunting of the wild animals, which has resulted in an increasing population of wild animals, including ibex, snow leopards and bears. Women of Lahaul are known for their strict action against felling of the trees. Not a single case of illegal tree felling has been reported in a decade from Lahaul valley.
