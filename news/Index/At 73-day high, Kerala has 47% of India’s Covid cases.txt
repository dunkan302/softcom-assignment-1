NEW DELHI: Indiaâs daily Covid-19 case count stayed below 15,000 for the third day running but infections spiked to a 73-day high in Kerala, which accounted for 47% of the all cases detected in the country on Saturday. India recorded 14,891 fresh cases of the coronavirus, a marginal rise from the previous dayâs tally of 14,413. Kerala reported nearly 7,000 new infections (6,960), its highest single-day count since November 11 last year, amid a discernible surge in infections in the state this week. Meanwhile, the seven-day rolling average of daily cases has fallen below the 14,000 mark, the lowest in seven months. The rolling average, which takes into account cases recorded over the past seven days, stood at 13,859 on Saturday. The last time the average daily count was below 14,000 was on June 21 last year. Maharashtra registered a slight dip in cases on Saturday, with 2,697 infections recorded in the state. The count on the previous day was 2,779. Yet, Maharashtra and Kerala continued to be the only states where the daily tally of cases was above 1,000. Together, the two states accounted for 65% of the national count on Saturday. Karnataka too reported a surge of sorts in the pandemic with 970 fresh infections detected in the state, up from 324 on the previous day. Out of these, 527 cases were from Bengaluru alone, the highest for any city in the country on Saturday. By contrast, Mumbai recorded 435 new cases, declining for the third day running. In Delhi, the number dropped to 197, the second time in the past six days that the national capital had reported less than 200 fresh Covid cases in a day. Chennai logged 153 new infections even as Tamil Nadu saw its active infection count dropping below 5,000, with 586 new cases and 673 recoveries. The nationwide death toll from the virus has stayed at around the same level in the past five days. On Saturday, 155 fatalities were recorded. The count has remained between 150 and 160 since Tuesday, lower than the fatalities recorded in the previous week. Maharashtra again registered the highest number of deaths at 56, followed by Kerala (23). Delhi, Bengal and Punjab reported 10 deaths each.
