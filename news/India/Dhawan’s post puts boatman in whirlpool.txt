VARANASI: The photographs posted by Indian team cricketer and left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan of feeding birds during a boat ride in the Ganga during his recent visit to Varanasi almost landed him in trouble since the district administration had imposed a strict ban on feeding birds due to the bird flu scare. The administration, however, gave a reprieve to Dhawan and decided to spare him, but has initiated action against the boatman, who did not stop the cricketer and did not inform him about the ban. The boatman is being identified and traced and will face action. Almost a week after the administration had imposed a ban, Dhawan had visited Kashi and fed migratory birds during a boat ride. The flouting of ban came to light when he himself uploaded pictures of his Kashi visit on his Instagram account on Friday, also including the one of feeding birds with a caption âHappiness is feeding birdsâ. When TOI contacted district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma on Sunday to know the action being initiated in this episode, he said, âTourists are generally not aware about local issues, directives and guidelines. Apart from river police and Varanasi Municipal Corporation, the boatmen had been made accountable for ensuring strict compliance of the ban. Hence, action would be taken against the boatman.â The district administration had taken note of the incident on Saturday and the river police were asked to search the boatman, who took him on a boat ride but did not stop him from feeding birds. The boatman could not be traced till Sunday evening. Dhawan had visited Kashi and posted photos of offering prayer at Kaal Bhairav temple on January 20.
