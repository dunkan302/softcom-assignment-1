BENGALURU: What do you do when work from home gets monotonous and taxing? If you happen to be Bakcen George, Allwyn Joseph or Ratish Bhalerao, chances are that you would be logging in to your workstation from a highway dhaba. When Covid-induced work from home got boring, the three friends took off on their cycles, pedalling over 1,600km across three states. They never missed out on office duties along the way. For George, 37, a digital marketing executive and adventure buff from Thane, the lockdown was trying. âI was slipping into depression and the dream of cycling from Mumbai to Kanyakumari was constantly on my mind. I knew I wasnât going to get 20 days leave to travel, so I thought why not work from a highway instead,â he said. On 19 November, George told childhood pals Joseph (37) and Bhalerao (36) of his plan. Both Joseph and Bhalerao, who didnât even own bicycles, decided to join him. âIt sounded very adventurous and clearly a change from the routine,â laughed Allwyn Joseph, an executive with a Mumbai-based logistics firm, who bought a second-hand cycle for the trip. Bhalerao had quit his job but was engaged in freelance online work. They began their trip from Kalyan on November 21, armed with a plan to pedal along the coast till Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu. âWe would ride from 4am to 11am and halt at dhabas or teashops to open our laptops and finish office work,â George said. They reached Kanyakumari on December 14.
