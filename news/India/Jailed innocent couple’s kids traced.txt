AGRA: The missing minor children of a couple jailed for five years for a crime they never committed were traced to separate childrenâs homes in Firozabad and Kanpur on Saturday. TOI had on Friday reported that the couple â Narendra Singh, 40, and wife Najma, 30 â was unable to trace their son Ajeet and daughter Anju, who were five and three at the time of the arrest in 2015. While Ajeet was found living at State Childrenâs Home for Boys in Firozabad, Anju was traced to State Childrenâs Home for Girls in Kanpur. According to sources, both the children were shifted to an Agra child protection home on October 24, 2019 after their grandfather Bhagwan Das expressed inability to take care of them citing poor financial condition. They had been handed over to their grandparents immediately after the coupleâs arrest on September 2, 2015. After 5 yearsâ jail, innocent couple comes out to find kids missingAgra CWC chairman Gopal Sharma said, âBoth were living separately since August last as only those up to 10 years are allowed in child protection homes. They were both sent to separate facilities after age verification revealed they were above 10 years.â Meanwhile, the coupleâs lawyer Vansho Baboo disputed Sharmaâs claims and said the children were wrongfully removed from the child protection home despite their age. He said the coupleâs priority now would be to reunite with them at the earliest, adding that they would meet the CWC officials on Monday to complete the formalities. Child rights activist Naresh Paras, too, sought the committeeâs urgent intervention. Promising all help to the couple, Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said that the district probationary officer is in touch with them and would provide all assistance to bring the children back to Agra.
