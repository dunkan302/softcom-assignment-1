BHOPAL: Congress members led by former CMs Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh had an intense showdown with police in Bhopal on Saturday during a protest against the Centreâs new farm laws. Hundreds of Congress workers rushed towards police barricades while cops fired tear gas and water cannons and lathicharged them to push them back. Singh and Kantilal Bhuria were among those arrested. Nath tweeted: âI strongly condemn the brutal lathicharge, tear-gas, water-cannons and the arrest of thousands of farmer brothers and Congress workers peacefully demonstrating in support of farmers.â
