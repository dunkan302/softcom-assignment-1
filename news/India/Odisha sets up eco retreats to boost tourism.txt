BHUBANESHWAR/KONARK: Confined to her home for most part of the pandemic since March last year, when 70-year-old Savitri Rout finally got the opportunity to go for a weekend getaway with her children and grandchildren in January, the family chose an âeco retreatâ along the Chandrabhaga beach in Konark. Sitting with her granddaughter in the dining area and watching the high tide hit the shore, she said she was happy to be out again. Safety remains a prime concern for those willing to step out but travelling very far is still not on the minds of many. Those keen on a holiday are clearly looking for spaces that can be the âone-stop shopâ for all their vacation needs. Also, while protocols exist, implementation and compliance is what dominates conversations among tourists. Speaking to TOI, Odishaâs minister for tourism and culture Jyoti Prakash Panigrahi said, âThere is no doubt that the tourism sector is one of the worst hit by the pandemic, but it is also a fact that the revival of this sector is a key priority area for us. We also want tourism in Odisha to grow beyond religious tourism so that people experience our coastal belt.â An experiment to test the waters is underway through the eco retreat model in Konark and four other sites in Odisha. Offering tourists the option to stay in temporary luxury tent cottages, the âglampingâ retreats came up in December and despite the pandemic, they have logged over 60% occupancy. The state set up the first glamping eco retreat in Konark last year. (The writer was in Odisha at the invitation of the state government)
