BAREILY: An octogenarian woman, who was mistakenly declared dead in legal documents, has been fighting a hard and lonely battle in Uttar Pradeshâs Moradabad district â to prove that she is alive. The woman reached out to the district administration officials during the recently held Sampoorna Samadhan Diwas and complained that she had not received the widowsâ pension for two years. The woman Sharifan, 80, claimed that she had been running from pillar to post, but to no avail. Officials said that a probe has been ordered into the case. âThe pension was stopped abruptly around two years ago. We made efforts to approach the officials, but nothing was done. It was later learned that her name was removed from the list of widowsâ pension beneficiaries as she was declared dead,â said Shariq Ali, a relative. âI tried to meet the officials concerned. Since then, I have been struggling to get my pension,â Sharifan said. Meanwhile, Moradabad sub-divisional magistrate Prashant Tiwari said, âIt has come to light that the woman was declared dead and stopped receiving her widowsâ pension. It is negligence on the part of officials. Local officials have been told to rectify the error.â
