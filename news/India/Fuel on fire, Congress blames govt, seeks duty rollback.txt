NEW DELHI: Attacking the Modi government over record jump in fuel prices, Congress on Sunday demanded that the Centre roll back excise duty on petrol and diesel imposed in the last six years. The party said the government should explain how it had spent the Rs 20 lakh crore earned through additional excise on fuel. âModiji has shown tremendous growth in âGDPâ ie gasdiesel-petrol prices. The public is plagued by inflation, Modi government is busy in tax collection,â Rahul Gandhi tweeted. Speaking to reporters, party spokesman Ajay Maken said excise duty on diesel was raised by 820% and on petrol by 258% during the BJPâs term. âWhen the UPA government was in power, the price of crude oil was $108 per barrel, but petrol and diesel were at Rs 71.5 and Rs 57.3 per litre, which have now increased to Rs 85.7 and Rs 75.8 in Delhi. This, when crude oil is far less than half of the rates during the UPA,â he said. Maken said without excise duty, the price of petrol would be Rs 61.9 per litre and diesel Rs 47.5 per litre, adding that excise duty on petrol was Rs 23.7 per litre and on diesel Rs 28.3. âThe government should explain where exactly this money has gone,â he said.
