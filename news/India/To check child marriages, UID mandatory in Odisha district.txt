BERHAMPUR: The Ganjam district administration has made Aadhaar verification of bride and groom mandatory before they tie the knot in an effort to make the district free of child marriage within six months. Ganjam district collector Vijay Amruta Kulange on Friday asked anganwadi workers to verify the details during every marriage. âIt will enable us to know the age of the bride and help us prevent child marriage,â he said during a meeting of the Nirbhaya Kadhi, an initiative taken by the district administration to raise awareness against child marriage. At the same time, the administration has also decided to fix responsibility on the priests and pundits who conduct child marriages. The collector has also sought peopleâs cooperation to erase the stigma of child marriage from the district. Earlier, the administration had announced cash reward of Rs 5,000 to those who inform about child marriage prior to it being solemnised. The administration has already declared 1,032 out of 3,250 villages (around one-third) in the district as child marriage-free. Similarly, 140 out of 286 wards in 18 urban local bodies (ULB) have been declared free of child marriage. Despite several programmes, reports of child marriages continues in the district. Last year, the administration had stopped as many as 228 child marriage bids as against 45 and 22 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Kulange has asked officers to keep strict vigil in areas where more number of such cases have been reported.
