As India celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, far away in Malaysia, K R Somasundram nostalgically recalled how as a 14-year-old, he convinced INA officials that he was ready, fit and 16 years old, the minimum age required to join the Azad Hind Fauj. âPossibly my demeanour misled them, or my eagerness won them over,â chuckles Somasundaram, now 90, chairman of Malaysiaâs plantation workersâ cooperative, the National Land Finance Cooperative Society Limited (NLFCS). Somasundram wasnât the only one. Recruitment officers of the INA met hundreds of young boys and even girls from different parts of Malaya peninsula and the island of Singapore, eager to lay down their lives for Indiaâs freedom after listening to Netajiâs stirring speeches. Remembering one such speech at Singaporeâs Cathay Theatre, Somasundaram said, âSuch was the magnetism of Netajiâs words that more than 2,000 people, both soldiers and citizens, stood still in overwhelming silence for two hours before breaking into thunderous applause after his speech.â For Somasundram himself, his first brush with the fiery leader came about as a helper in a shop in his hometown. âWith the British retreating in 1942, our schools also closed and my father decided to send me to work at his friendâs shop. I heard inspiring stories of Indiaâs freedom struggle and also read them in newspapers.â âThe one thing that really built the Azad Hind Fauj and stands even today as a testimony to Netajiâs leadership is the training we received as army recruits,â added Somasundram. At the Azad School of Training, Somasundram underwent a 9-month course in guerilla warfare and jungle training, under former Indian Army officers who had joined the INA. âRoman Hindi was used in the INA and hence no language barriers existed; we were all one,â he said.
