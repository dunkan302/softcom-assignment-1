NEW DELHI: For Sunitha Dugar and her four companions who are part of a national âSafe Speed Challengeâ, driving on Indian roads is nothing less than âplaying a video gameâ in real life and one doesnât know who will come from where on to the road. âWhen you are driving on the road, you should be prepared for surprises. So, itâs your responsibility to save yourself and save others. Itâs actually a real video game on the road risking many lives,â said Sunita, an entrepreneur from Chennai. The five women from different walks of life are participating in the challenge that was flagged off by defence minister Rajnath Singh and road transport minister Nitin Gadkari from Wagah to Kanyakumari. Several factors, including poor infrastructure, unsafe driving, inadequate enforcement and trauma care have made Indian roads unsafe claiming 415 lives daily. Speaking to TOI, Neha Dua from Noida said, âWe lack safety culture. More than speeding, speed management is the biggest challenge. You hardly find signage and road markings to help driversâ. For Chaitanya Keloth from Bengaluru, the challenges have been manoeuvring between trucks, rickshaws and cyclists etc. For Amritha Avind, another Bangalorean, the biggest challenge are people not following the traffic rules and confusing signals. Garima Avtar, the first woman who has been driving professionally for Mercedes Benz Luxe Drive since 2016, the biggest challenge is the mechanism and procedures for issuing licences. âPeople who are not fit to drive and donât know the traffic guidelines properly are able to obtain driving licences. This makes our roads dangerous,â she said.
