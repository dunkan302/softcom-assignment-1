HYDERABAD: In a first such move, bar councils of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala on Sunday came together and unanimously demanded a Supreme Court bench in south India. The councils said, they made the demand keeping in mind the people who end up relinquishing the idea of accessing the highest court of justice due to lack of reach and their inability to afford the costs of reaching a faraway Supreme Court. The chiefs of these bar councils deliberated on this demand at a webinar organised by the Telangana state bar council. They elected Telangana bar council chairman A Narasimha Reddy as convenor of the committee formed to achieve this goal. Though the demand for a SC bench has been there for a while, it is for the first time that top legal experts from the region have jointly vowed to fight for it. Reddy said it was incomprehensible as to why the SC is not setting up its appellate benches in four parts of the country. âThe Supreme Court at Delhi can exclusively concentrate on constitutional issues while its appellate benches in the four corners would decide the appeals emanating from the high courts,â he said. The bar councils unanimously resolved to seek an appointment and meet President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, PM Narendra Modi, law minister, the Chief Justice of India, and all the judges of the Supreme Court in the coming days. The delegation will brief them about the problems faced by the people of south India, whose cases are pending at the high courts because reaching the Supreme Court is considered âimpracticalâ in terms of affordability, the delegates said. The meeting also decried the exorbitant fees charged by advocates of the Supreme Court. This is making the top court affordable only by the rich and the corporates, they said.
