NEW DELHI: Several Supreme Court judges on Saturday recalled the days of Emergency as one of the âdarkest hours of democracyâ and stressed on commitment to constitutional values. They also lamented on deteriorating standards of legal education in the country with mushrooming of law colleges all over, stating that something needed to be done urgently to improve education and research in the field of law. Justices NV Ramana, DY Chandrachud, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Surya Kant, while participating through video conferencing for launch of a book by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, shared their views about the Emergency period when they were college students. They appreciated the timely release of his book on the law of emergency when the whole world is witnessing another emergency situation due to Covid-19. Chandrachud, who was a classmate of Kaul and Singhvi in Delhi University, recalled his days during the Emergency which he termed as âone of the darkest hoursâ of democracy. Ramana said he was about to preside over a meeting in Andhra Pradesh on June 25, 1975 when police came and disrupted the meeting and he had to flee from the spot amid the commotion. He said the Emergency had lasting effect on generations. Appreciating the scholarly work of Singhvi in writing the book and his commitment to constitutional values, Kaul said there is a need to improve the quality of law education and research in India. Ramana also agreed with Kaul and said, âI hope we can take up the issue in coming days.â
