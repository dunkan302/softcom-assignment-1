MUMBAI: A sales tax officer, dead for almost two decades, has 25 years after his conviction been acquitted in a corruption and refunds conspiracy case of 1985. A few days ago, Bombay high court allowed his appeal against conviction. His widow and son had in 2015 stepped into his shoes to continue with the appeal filed in 1996, against the conviction, an 18 month imprisonment and Rs 26000 fine. In September 1996 a special trial court in Solapur had convicted Suresh Kagne and two other sales tax officials, relying largely on the testimony of an approver â the son of another co-accused, an oil mill owner. He had been granted pardon at the fag end of the trial after 92 of the 94 prosecution witnesses were examined, âobviously to fill up lacunae in the case,ââ said the HC in its judgmenton January 19. Kagne was tried with two other public servants and a registered âdealerâ of an oil extraction business and his son. The charges included conspiracy to making and securing a false claim of refund of sales tax, admissible to those engaged in business of extracting oil from oilseeds and âtel ghanisâ (mini oil mills). A co-accused had granted registration to the dealerâs son. Kagne had allegedly âwithout following due process accepted the claims for set off ââ of Rs 2.6 lakh, thus causing a loss to the state exchequer. The HC did not find the approverâs testimony reliable. Earlier in 2013, the HC had acquitted two of Kagneâs co-accused, also sales tax officials, while allowing their separate appeals against their conviction.
