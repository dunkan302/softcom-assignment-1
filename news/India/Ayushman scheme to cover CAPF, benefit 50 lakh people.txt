GUWAHATI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday announced extension of the Ayushman Bharat health scheme to Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) and said it will benefit 50 lakh people, including CAPF personnel and their families. While launching the scheme at CRPF group centre at Amerigog, ninth mile in Guwahati, Shah lambasted those who have been criticising the efficacies of Covid-19 vaccines, saying that there should be no politics on public health, PTI reported. âThere are some people who are spreading misinformation on vaccine. Come to another platform and letâs have a duel. But why are you creating doubt over peopleâs health and doing politics? There are other issues for that,â he said. Shah said formalities for Ayushman Bharat health scheme will be completed soon. He said he had had a dialogue with jawans where he zeroed in on three issues which is confronting CAPF. âOne was the availability of health-related expenditure and reimbursement for jawans and their family members, besides availability of treatment at hospitals. Satisfaction ratio and recruitment to fill up vacancy in CAPF were the others,â he stated. âWe have to ensure that those who guard the borders of India and keep its sovereignty and integrity intact donât have to worry about the health and other issues of their family,â the minister said. He said PM Modi has said the poor have the first right over Indiaâs resource. Shah said treatment will be available across 24,000 hospitals in the country. âThis is PMâs gift to CAPF,â he said.
