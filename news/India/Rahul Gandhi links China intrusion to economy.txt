DHARAPURAM: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the Chinese gathered guts to intrude into the Indian territory because of a weakening economy which was the result of flawed policies of âweakâ PM Modi. âThe Chinese understand that the man running this country is weak. They understand that the PM has destroyed the economy of India. That is why they are inside our territory,â Rahul said on Sunday at Dharapuram town in Tirupur district of Tamil Nadu. âAs we speak today, thousands of Chinese troops are occupying our territory and the man with a 56-inch chest cannot even say the word China. That is the reality of our country,â he said. He spoke on similar lines earlier in the day while addressing weavers in Erode. On day two of his three-day election campaign in Tamil Nadu, Rahul focused on attacking Modi rather than the AIADMK dispensation, which he sought to replace with a government that âcannot be controlled by BJPâ. Rahul said BJPâs economic policies had âdealt a severe blow to farmers, weavers, labourers and MSMEsâ, who are foundation of the country. âI can tell you without doubt if the Indian economy was strong, China would have never got the guts to step into India,â Rahul said.
