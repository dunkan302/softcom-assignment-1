CHANDIGARH: Unable to control the ever-increasing death rate, Punjab has decided to examine if a mutated coronavirus strain has entered the state, causing deaths at a higher rate. The state government has decided to send 5% of positive samples to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) for examination. In January, when rest of India saw a steady decline in the Covid-19 positivity rate and cases, Punjab continued to battle with a high death rate. The fatality rate in the state shot up while the positivity rate witnessed a dip from 2 % to 1% in the last 22 days and the R-value slipped as well, indicating a slower spread. According to sources, the government is looking to ascertain the reasons for high death rate despite taking all the corrective measures recommended by the state and central health experts. The data of the health department showed that the rate at which people succumbed to the virus from January 1-22 was 4.1% against the stateâs overall fatality rate of 3.2%. During this period, 194 people out of 4,752 infected by the virus died. So far, 5,543 people have lost their lives in the state. In the last 30 days, as many as six districts had death rate over 10%.
