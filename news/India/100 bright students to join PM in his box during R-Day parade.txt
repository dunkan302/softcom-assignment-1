NEW DELHI: One hundred meritorious students from schools and colleges will join Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his box to together witness the Republic Day parade on Tuesday. According to Ramesh Pokhriyal, Union education minister, the students will also have a chance to interact with him after the parade. âHappy to share that meritorious students across the country will be given a chance to witness the RepublicDay2021 parade from the PMâs Box. They will also have a chance to meet & interact with the minister of education, Govt. of India Shri @DrRPNishank,â the ministry of education tweeted.

A total of 105 toppers from CBSE and universities got to watch the 71st Republic Day Parade from the PMâs box last year. Due to the Covid-19 safety norms gravity-defying stunts by motorcycle-borne men, a major attraction for the crowd at Republic Day celebrations on the Rajpath, will be missing this year, while the spectator size too has been reduced to 25,000, officials said on Friday
