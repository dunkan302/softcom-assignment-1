LONDON: UK prime minister Boris Johnson is believed to be the first world leader outside North America and the third leader in the world to get a call from new US president Joe Biden in what is seen as significant boost to UK-US relations post Brexit. The two leaders spoke on Saturday and vowed to deepen the special relationship between the USA and Britain and drive a green and sustainable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between the two countries. The call to the UK prime minister on Saturday evening follows Biden's first two calls after entering the White House which he made to Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador on Friday. This makes Johnson the first leader outside North America to get the coveted phone call â ahead of the likes of Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany and MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin, the Irish prime minister. Biden has Irish roots. Johnson tweeted a photo of the call and said: âGreat to speak to President @JoeBiden this evening. I look forward to deepening the longstanding alliance between our two countries as we drive a green and sustainable recovery from COVID-19.â Great to speak to President @JoeBiden this evening.

A Downing Street spokesperson said: âThe Prime Minister congratulated the President on his inauguration and the two leaders looked forward to deepening the close alliance between our nations.â The two leaders noted the significant challenges facing the world during the pandemic, but also the unparalleled opportunities to âbuild back better and greener togetherâ. The UK Prime Minister praised President Bidenâs early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach Net Zero by 2050.  âThe Prime Minister warmly welcomed the Presidentâs decision to re-join the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as the World Health Organization and the COVAX programme to ensure equitable access for vaccines,â Number 10 said. Building on the UK and USâ long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and their shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy.  âThey also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries, and the Prime Minister reiterated his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible,â Downing Street added.  âThe leaders looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow, and to working together through the G7, G20 and COP26 this year.â Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be attending the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall in Britain from 11 to 13 June. The UK will host the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in November, which follows on from the G20 summit in Rome at the end of October.
