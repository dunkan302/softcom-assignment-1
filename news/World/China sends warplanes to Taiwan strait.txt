HONG KONG: China sent warplanes into the Taiwan Strait over the weekend, a show of force to the Biden administration that signals Beijingâs plans to maintain pressure on Taiwan even as it calls for a reset with the United States. Taiwanâs military said that four Chinese fighter jets, eight bombers and one anti-submarine aircraft entered its southwestern air defense identification zone and crossed the midline that divides the Taiwan Strait on Saturday. That was followed by 12 fighters, two anti-submarine aircraft and a reconnaissance plane Sunday. While such drills have been common and sometimes larger in recent years, the timing of this effort, just days after a new U.S. administration took office, drew notice in both Taipei, Taiwan, and Washington. Taiwanâs military said it sent radio warnings to the Chinese planes, put defense missile systems on alert and dispatched patrol aircraft to monitor them. Ned Price, a State Department spokesperson, said in a statement released Saturday that the United States ânotes with concern the pattern of ongoing PRC attempts to intimidate its neighbors, including Taiwan,â referring to the Peopleâs Republic of China. âWe urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwanâs democratically elected representatives.â Also on Saturday, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a U.S. aircraft carrier, entered the South China Sea with its accompanying strike group on what the Navy described as âroutine operationsâ to âensure freedom of the seas.â While Chinese military officials did not necessarily plan drills with the new U.S. administration in mind, the timing could have value for Beijing, said Drew Thompson, a former Pentagon official responsible for China and now a research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. âI think itâs a mistake to assume that everything is a signal,â he said. âBut certainly the operation is both militarily expedient in terms of training and experience but also a very useful political signal to not only Taiwan but of course the new Biden administration.â
