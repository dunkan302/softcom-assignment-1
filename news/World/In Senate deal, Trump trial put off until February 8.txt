Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer struck a deal with Republican leader Mitch McConnell that puts off former President Trumpâs impeachment trial for two weeks, allowing the chamber to forge ahead with confirmation votes on President Bidenâs cabinet picks. The Houseâs single article of impeachment â âinciting an insurrectionâ by stoking a mob into storming the Capitol â will be ceremoniously delivered on Monday to the Senate chamber, and read aloud.  But House Democratic impeachment managers and Trumpâs defence team then have until the week of February 8 to draft opposing briefs. The deal for this deferred timetable resolves one of Bidenâs main challenges â providing days in-between to potentially fill the presidentâs cabinet and begin work on his Covid-relief plan. It also reflects a compromise with McConnell, who urged setting a timetable that would have pre-trial arguments filed by February 11.
